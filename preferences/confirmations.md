# Confirmation and Warning Messages for Folders

## Include Filtered Items By Default

When a copy/move operation begins the filtered files are not included, it is possible to change this behavior turning on this option.

If the summary dialog doesn't appear, this option can be changed without accessing to preference dialog simply holding down the ALT key while clicking on toolbar button or context menu item

# Confirmation for Documents

As any application in the world, closing a window with settings changed (comparison method, filters, alignment rules and so on) will show a confirmation dialog.

This prompt can be annoying when user does many quick comparisons and doesn't want to save any session, if this is your case the prompt can be suppressed turning on this option.

As usual the user can always save the session selecting Save or Save As from the File menu.

<strong>WARNING</strong> if this option is on and you spend a lot of time to define the filters or the alignment rules and then you close the window/application any settings will be lost, use this option with care.
